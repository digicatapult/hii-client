This hydrogen could be used as a clean fuel for buses, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and cars, helping to reduce air pollution and improve air quality on local roads. As part of the Plastic Parks, a hydrogen refuelling station is planned, taking hydrogen from the plastic to the hydrogen facility. This aims to supply up to 1000kg of hydrogen per day to vehicles, sufficient to fuel approximately 20 HGVs from outside Protos and a similar number of internal HGV movements that will be servicing operations within Protos.

Nanomox Oxidative Ionothermal Synthesis (OIS) uses green catalytic solvents at low temperatures to complete the direct oxidation of metals, offering potentially enormous energy efficiency improvements over existing technologies. This patent pending process can treat metal-containing wastes, prevent landfills, reduce reliance on energy intensive pyrometallurgical processes and co-produce significant volumes of hydrogen during operation. Wastes from the steelmaking process will be converted into saleable materials for industrial use (for example, zinc oxide) while the hydrogen produced is used as fuel on plant. ",
